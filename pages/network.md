A network is a group of computers that are connected to each other.

There are different layouts of networks:

* ring network
	* network of nodes connected left and right so they form a ring, allowing
		any node to be reached by going either left or right
* mesh network
	* nodes are connected to a arbitrary amount of other nodes, so there is at
		least one path for all nodes to reach each others
