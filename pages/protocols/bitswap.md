Bitswap is the technology IPFS uses to trade blocks on the network.

Bitswap is a block exchange protocol, modeled as a market.

Bitswap has a WantList, ProvideList and announces this to the network, whereas
the network either sends blocks that are in the WantList to the node, or helps
other nodes find your node based on the ProvideList.
