In electronic communication, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the
core members of the Internet protocol suite. With UDP, computer applications
can send messages, in this case referred to as datagrams, to other hosts on
an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Prior communications are not required in
order to set up transmission channels or data paths.
