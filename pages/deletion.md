Deletions are not possible in the IPFS network, similar to how the web works today.

Once content is published on the internet, there are many people who save it as
soon as they see it, and in cases like Github, there are robots watching content
and saving everything miliseconds after it appears. On the web today, you are
never really sure that something is deleted since it's been public once.

IPFS is similar. The only way content can be "deleted" is if there is no more
nodes providing the content.
