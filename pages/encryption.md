Encryption is very important to ensure that content is 1) hidden from people
watching your pipes (network transport) and 2) hidden from people who want to
look at content that are not meant from them.

## Transport Encryption

IPFS has secio which deals with encryption on the transport layer.

## Content Encryption

There is currently no built-in way of doing encrypted content. But, it's very
trivial to encrypt content yourself before adding it to IPFS, and then decrypt
when receiving it.
