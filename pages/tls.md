Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL), both frequently referred to as "SSL", are cryptographic protocols that
provide communications security over a computer network. Several versions
of the protocols find widespread use in applications such as web browsing,
email, Internet faxing, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP (VoIP).
Websites use TLS to secure all communications between their servers and
web browsers.
