A MerkleDAG is a data structure used in many applications and IPFS as well.

It's a directed acyclic graph with merkle-links as edges. Merkle-links gives MerkleDAGs
the property of allowing links to objects to authenticate themselves. 

It's a general data structure that helps when building distributed systems.

Anyone can verify the content and it's links in a MerkleDAG.

It was the groundwork for what we now call IPLD.
