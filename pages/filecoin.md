Filecoin is a cryptocurrency leveraging Ethereum as a blockchain.

Filecoin is based around the idea that people have lots of unused harddrive space
while there are others that has lots of content but small amount of space free.

Filecoin makes it possible to rent harddrive space in a P2P way, via IPFS.

Filecoin also makes it possible for people with lots of space to earn money
by renting out their space to people willing to pay for it.
