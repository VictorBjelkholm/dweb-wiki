Proposed structure of this wiki.


## Top-Level Namespace

Only `Home` should be here, together with categories.

### IPFS
### IPLD
### Multiformats
### libp2p
### Research

Research about things related to IPFS and it's sister-projects

### Misc

Everything that doesn't fit under any other category. Once there is enough
pages related to a subject, it might warrent it's own category, but it starts
out with being a group of pages in `Misc` category.

### Related Projects

Projects and other technologies that are related to IPFS and sister-projects but
not directly associated.

### Distributed Web

Pages about the distributed web. How to build and structure applications. What
applications currently exists, what applications we want to exist.

### Meta

Everything that is about this wiki itself.
