In telecommunications, a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow
two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any
kind of variation of a physical quantity. These are the rules or standard that
defines the syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible
error recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or
a combination of both.
